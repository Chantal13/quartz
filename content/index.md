Welcome to my brain!

I’m Chantal, based in Toronto, Canada. These days, I’ve been unwinding with a bit of [[Python]] programming—there’s something satisfying about tinkering with code after a busy day. I also pick up my guitar now and then, just for the joy of making music.

Here, you’ll find my reflections on neurodiversity, tech adventures, and the little things that make up everyday life. Take a look around, and I hope you find something that resonates with you. Thanks for stopping by.
