[Python Programming MOOC 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/)

The **Python Programming MOOC 2025** from the University of Helsinki’s MOOC.fi platform is a free, self-paced online course designed for both beginners and progressing learners.

The program is split into two parts: the **Introduction to Programming** (Parts 1–7), covering Python basics like syntax, variables, loops, functions, and lists, and the **Advanced Course in Programming** (Parts 8–14), which builds on these foundations with more complex topics.

I like the way the lessons are bite-sized like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com), but to do more than two lessons a day, a paid subscription is required.
