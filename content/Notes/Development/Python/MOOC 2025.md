# Part 1

These were fun ones. These types of exercises used to be a bit annoying, but I think my brain works in code a lot better.

```
# Name and Address

given = input("What is your given name? ")

family = input("What is your family name? ")

address = input("What is your street address? ")

city = input("What is your city and postal code? ")

print(given + " " + family)

print(address)

print(city)
```


```
# Totally plausible story

name = input("Please type in a name: ")

year = input("Please type in a year: ")

print(name + " is a valiant knight, born in the year " + year + ". One morning " + name + " woke up to an awful racket: a dragon was approaching the village. Only " + name + " could save the village's residents.")
```
