# Quartz v4

> ‚Äú[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.

## Environment Variables

Quartz reads configuration from an optional `.env.local` file at runtime. Use
this file to provide API tokens or other secrets that shouldn't be committed to
version control. A sample file is provided as `.env.local.example`:

```env
TOKEN=your_token_here
```
