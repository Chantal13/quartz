# Quartz v4

> ‚Äú[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.
