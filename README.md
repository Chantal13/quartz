# Quartz v4

> ‚Äú[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.

## Local Environment

Some CLI features talk to the hosted Quartz API (e.g. checking for updates or publishing).
Create a `.env.local` file at the project root and add an API token so these requests are authenticated:

```bash
TOKEN=YOURTOKEN
```

You can generate a personal token from your account settings on the Quartz website.
Quartz will load this file automatically when the CLI starts.
